## About QV

QV is an Indonesian Venture Builder and Investment (VBI) company that works with Enterprises to re-imagine, re-build, and scale new business with deep tech differentiators. QV helps its partners to develop the core competencies of business and technologies to enable Science+Engineering (SE) based innovation capabilities.

Most Enterprises aren’t built for change to anticipate technology disruptions. They spend a lot of time monitoring the changes from externals, but don’t always know how to make the first move internally. Not only will they be left behind, they will not be able to sustain their businesses in future.

Many of the world’s most successful Enterprises take a different journey. They consistently build new business and technology core competencies at incredible speed, innovating new products and features, while leveraging what they already do best in the markets. The efforts required in that journey are not always easy, but necessary to survive. This is why QV exists in Indonesia.

## QV Core Values

QV was established in 2022 with a strong vision to be a trusted deep-tech VBI for Enterprises to drive SE-based innovation capabilities. QV core values are deducted from Fundamental, Conceptual and Practical (FCP) understanding in a specific technological domain known as ABCD - AI, Blockchain, Cloud and Data, combined with decades of experiences in business developments and operations. QV works to inspire, discover, accelerate, and scale business innovations based on scientific and engineering explorations and achievements.
